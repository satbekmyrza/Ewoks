# STATUS

## Badge

We are applying for the _Reusable Badge_

## Reasons

Since _reusable_ requires the artifact to also be _available_ and _functional_
we how our artifact satisfies each.

### Available

The artifact is available both as a virtual machine and also under a public
repository <https://github.com/vrthra/ewoks> which also contains
instructions for building of the complete virtual machine package. Further,
the DOI for the VM is 10.5281/zenodo.4455546

### Functional

1. The algorithm and experiments are carefully documented, and an interactive
   notebook is available from the VM. A read-only view is here:
   <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vrthra/Ewoks/blob/master/src/FAlgebra.ipynb>

2. The artifact produces results that are consistent with the paper, and we
   show how it can be obtained, and results can be evaluated.

3. The artifact is complete in that the complete virtual machine is available
   as a vagrant box at https://zenodo.org/record/4455546 (7.6 GB download)

4. The artifact is exercisable as we show how to run the experiments and
   extract results that have one to one correspondence with the tables in the
   paper.

5. The artifact contains sufficient evidence to verify our claim, and we also
   show how one can add new programs.

### Reusable

The artifact is carefully structured, and the implementation is available both
as an interactive Jupyter notebook as well as extracted in the form of a well
structured Python module that can be used and extended by other researchers.
Each part of the algorithm is carefully documented in the _Jupyter notebook_
with relevant examples.  We believe that this makes our package very easy to
use. An evidence for this is in how easy it is to add a new program to our setup
as we describe in the README file.
