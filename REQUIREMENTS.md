The basic requirement is a computer that can run a virtual machine with 16 GB RAM.
That is, the host should contain more memory than 16 GB. While the VM may work
with 10 GB RAM, we have not tried it.

# Software requirements

* VirtualBox 5.2.18 (Other versions may also work. This is what we tried)
* Vagrant 2.2.7 (As before, other versions may also work)
